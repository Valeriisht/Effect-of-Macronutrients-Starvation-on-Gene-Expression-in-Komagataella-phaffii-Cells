- The development of new methods of analysis makes ***Komagataella phaffi*** yeast a model object of biotechnology and genetics, which in turn stimulates their further study and use as an object of biotechnological research.  In our work, a study was conducted to investigate the effect of phosphate and biotin deficiency on changes in yeast gene expression using transcriptome analysis methods.
